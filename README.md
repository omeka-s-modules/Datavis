# Data Visualization

An [Omeka S](https://omeka.org/s/) module for visualizing your data.

The Data Visualization module allows site administrators to generate datasets and render diagrams that reflect the complexities of their collections. Once installed and activated on the Modules section of the admin dashboard, Data Visualization is managed on a site-by-site basis. You can add your data diagrams to site pages using page blocks.

Some visualizations allow users to interact and navigate through to items or sets; others are static representations of site information. Some will require you to reformat or convert your metadata to make it readable by Data Visualization.

All of the time- and date-based visualizations require Numeric Data Types to be installed and active on your installation, and your date values to be formatted correctly. You may also find Data Cleaning and Faceted Browse to be useful modules for seeing and fixing inconsistencies in your data, to make for better visualizations.

Data visualizations can be created and modified by Global Administrators and Supervisors, and by users set to Manager on individual sites. Site Creators can view visualization diagrams and datasets but not create or modify visualizations.

The visualization options include:

- Count of items with classes, which visualizes the count of items that are instances of selected resource classes.
- Count of items in item sets, which visualizes the count of items that are assigned to selected item sets.
- Count of items with properties, which visualizes the count of items that have selected properties.
- Count of items with property values, which visualizes the count of items that have selected values of a selected property.
- Count of property values, which visualizes the count of values of a selected property.
- Count of items with property values in a time series, which visualizes the count of items that have selected values of a selected property over a selected period of time.
- Count of items in a time series, which visualizes the count of items over a selected period of time.
- Count of property values, which visualizes the count of values of a selected property of items.
- Item relationships, which visualizes the relationships between items via their resource values.
